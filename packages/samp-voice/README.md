## Getting started

```sh
pnpm add @infernus/core @infernus/samp-voice
```

## Example

```ts

    The public OnPlayerActivationKeyPress and OnPlayerActivationKeyRelease
    are needed in order to redirect the player's audio traffic to the
    corresponding streams when the corresponding keys are pressed.
